# justalist
very simple full-stack app displaying a list of work items (like chapters of a publication or features for a release - helping creative teams to deliver in time). I started this to stay up to speed in the JS universe - and to use technologies far beyond the bare minimum to which projects most of the time constrain. Nothing is in heret that a spreadsheet could not do and not remotely as powerful as one of the cool work management tools out there - but simple (in fact: ultra-simple) and nice ;-)
