# justalist
very simple full-stack app displaying a list of work items (like chapters of a publication or features for a release, or status of systems or ... - helping creative teams to deliver in time). I started this to stay up to speed in the JS universe (knowing I'll never truly be) - and to use technologies far beyond the bare minimum to which projects most of the time constrain. Nothing is in here that a spreadsheet could not do and it's not remotely as powerful as one of the cool work management tools out there - but simple (in fact: ultra-simple), versatile and nice ;-)
